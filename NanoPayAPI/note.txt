partner_dashboard:
	display services with apikeys, and service code.


APIKeys -- sort of

make the interfaces look pretty

remove unnecasary json encoding

error handleing for CRUD on dbs, particularly for user and partner credit
implement some custom error handleing, so partner and user can find out what went wrong.

possible future:
a way for partners to pay users
why have users and partners as different enitiies? law and for serverside/clientside scripting// users use session storage, servers use api keys
